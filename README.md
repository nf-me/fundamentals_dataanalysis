# Project & Tasks

## Overview
This project is centered on the analysis of the well-known Fisher Iris dataset. It includes two Jupyter Notebooks: one covering various data analysis tasks and the other focusing specifically on the Fisher Iris dataset. The notebooks demonstrate data loading, variable classification, summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.

## Contents
- `tasks.ipynb`: Notebook containing tasks performed throughout the semester, covering different aspects of data analysis.
- `iris_analysis.ipynb`: Notebook dedicated to the in-depth analysis of the Fisher Iris dataset.
